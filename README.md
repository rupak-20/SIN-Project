Star Wars is an American epic space-opera [multimedia franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.

The franchise depicts the adventures of characters "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away", in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), who may assist them in their daily routines; space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology. Spacecraft range from small starfighters, to huge capital ships such as the Star Destroyers, to space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars. Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, and holographic projections.

A mystical power known as the Force is described in the original film as "an energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together". Through training and meditation, those whom "the Force is strong with" are able to perform various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy). The Force is wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression. While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.

Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the population. The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called a lightsabre, a blade of energy that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use laser-powered blaster firearms. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant. Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments. Illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.

We selected this franchise because it has a vast variety of unique characters with complex and non-repetitive interactions. Thus, it provided us an unique opportunity to experiment with different techniques and algorithms learnt in this course. A brief summary of different measures in this graph-

Degree Centrality: By this method of measuring the importance of the node in a given network we define that the node with the highest degree is more important and hence it is having greater impact over rest of the other nodes.

Closeness Centrality: By this method of measuring the importance of node in a given network, we take the average distance of a node from all the other nodes. Whichever node has a lesser average value is the node which is nearer to every node and thus it is the node with the higher centrality. 
Betweenness Centrality: In this, all the shortest paths between the nodes are taken and observed which node is visited most of the times while traversing the shortest paths and such a most visited node is the one with highest centrality or that is the node with greater importance.

Eigen Vector Centrality: This method assigns a relative value to a node with respect to the nodes it relates to. So the one which is connected to a node with better importance will always get a better centrality value. This is used in Google Page Ranking algorithm using walking botsâ€™ method.

Clustering Coefficient: In graph theory, a clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.

Average path length: Average path length is a concept in network topology that is defined as the average number of steps along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes. It is a measure of the efficiency of information or mass transport on a network

Homophily: Network homophily refers to the theory in network science which states that, based on node attributes, similar nodes may be more likely to attach to each other than dissimilar ones.
